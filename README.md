# CIFAR-10 Image Classification Project

## Overview
This repository showcases a Python project for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. CIFAR-10 is a widely used benchmark dataset for computer vision tasks. The project covers data preprocessing, dimensionality reduction with PCA, model training, and hyperparameter tuning.

## Project Details
- **Data Preprocessing:** The project begins with data preprocessing, which involves dataset loading and exploration using the `Cifar10_Project.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook. The exploration includes loading images and labels and visualizing a subset of the data.

- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** The project incorporates dimensionality reduction using PCA to extract the most important features from the images. This process is detailed in the `Cifar10_Project.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook.

- **Model Training:** A RandomForestClassifier is trained on the transformed training data for image classification.

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** The project explores hyperparameter tuning for a Support Vector Classifier (SVC) to optimize model accuracy.

## Results
The project provides insights into the CIFAR-10 dataset, showcases the visualized eigenfaces, and evaluates the performance of the image classification model.
